Transform your PDF experience with tools that rival desktop software:

    *   **Extract**: Pull specific page ranges (e.g., "1-5, 10") into a new PDF.
    *   **Merge**: Drag & drop multiple PDF files to combine them into one master document.
*   **🔍 Advanced Find & Replace**: Search with Regex support. "Replace" text visibly by overlaying new content seamlessly (perfect for quick edits).

### 🎙️ **Universal Accessibility**
