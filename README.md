### 🚀 New Pro Features (v2.0)

#### 🧠 Advanced AI Capabilities
*   **Streaming Table of Contents**: Chapters and sections appear **instantly** in the sidebar as the AI discovers them. No more waiting for the full scan to finish!
*   **Intelligent Auto-Resume**: The system remembers your progress. If a manual scan fails or an API limit is hit, the AI **automatically resumes** searching from where it left off.
*   **Robust multi-Key Rotation**: Automatically switches between API keys if one gets exhausted, ensuring 99.9% uptime for heavy textbook analysis.

#### 🎙️ Universal Text-to-Speech
*   **OCR Fallback Engine**: Can now read **scanned images** and non-selectable text aloud by intelligently "seeing" the page content first.
*   **Smart Reconstruction**: Reads complex layouts (columns, sidebars) in the correct human-readable order, not just computer line-order.
*   **Instant Playback**: Uses "pre-warming" technology to prevent browser audio blocking, ensuring speech starts the moment you click.

#### 🛠️ Enhanced Productivity
*   **Manual Priority Mode**: Know the page number? Type it in and hit "Extract" to instantly pause the background scan and prioritize your request.
*   **Native File Saving**: Integrated with the file system to let you choose exactly where to save your annotated PDFs (supported browsers only).
